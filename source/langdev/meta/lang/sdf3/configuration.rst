SDF3 Configuration
--------------------

When using SDF3 inside Spoofax, it is possible to specify different configuration options that. They allow
using the new parser generator, specifying the shape of completion placeholders, or disable
SDF altogether. These options should be specified in the :file:`metaborg.yaml` file.

For example, to disable SDF for the current project, use:

.. code-block:: yaml

   language:
       sdf:
         enabled: false

This configuration should be present when defining language components for a language that has SDF enabled.

SDF3 allows generating placeholders for code completion. The default "shape" of placeholders is ``[[Symbol]]``. However, it is possible
to tweak this shape using the configuration below (the configuration for suffix is optional):

.. code-block:: yaml

   language:
     sdf:
       placeholder:
         prefix: "$"
         suffix: "$"

Currently, the path to the parse table is specified in the :file:`Syntax.esv` file, commonly as ``table: target/metaborg/sdf.tbl``.
When the ESV file does not contain this entry, it is also possible to specify the path to the parse table in the :file:`metaborg.yaml` file.
This is useful when testing an external parse table, or using a parse table different from the one being generated in the project.
In the example below, the table is loaded from the path ``tables/sdf.tbl``. The same can be applied to the parse table used for code completion.

.. code-block:: yaml

   language:
     sdf:
       parse-table: "tables/sdf.tbl"
       completion-parse-table: "tables/sdf-completions.tbl"

In a Spoofax project, it is also possible to use SDF2 instead of SDF3. This enables SDF2 tools such as the SDF2 parenthesizer,
signature generator, etc. For example:

.. code-block:: yaml

   language:
     sdf:
       version: sdf2


Finally, by default SDF3 compilation works by generating SDF2 files, and depending on the SDF2 toolchain. However,
a new (and experimental) parse table generator can be selected by writing:

.. code-block:: yaml

   language:
     sdf:
       sdf2table: java

This configuration disables the SDF2 generation, and may cause problems when defining grammars to use concrete syntax, since
this feature is not supported yet by SDF3. Furthermore, ``dynamic`` can be used instead of ``java``, to enable lazy parse table
generation, where the parse table is generated while the program is parsed.

Also, an experimental new version of the SGLR parser implementation is available: JSGLR2. It supports parsing, imploding and
syntax highlighting. Error reporting, recovery and completions are currently not supported. It can be enabled with:

.. code-block:: yaml

   language:
     sdf:
       jsglr-version: v2

.. warning:: Whenever changing any of these configurations, clean the project before rebuilding.

.. TODO: write documentation on how to use SDF3 outside of Spoofax
